# CalTTC-Website

Website Direction: How to get Started

1. Clone the old website repository from github to your machine: https://github.com/CalTTC/CalTTCwebpage. (I recommend cloning it to a folder on your desktop.)
as well as the new website repository: https://github.com/AntonioMolteni/CalTTC-Website
2. Download Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and get the extensions called “Live Server” and “HTML CSS Support”. Importantly, RESTART VS Code afterwards.
3. Locate a folder called “_site” in the old repository you cloned and open this in VS Code. This is the old website folder.  The new website folder is just repository you already cloned: "CalTTC-Website"
4. Inside VS Code, select File > Open Folder and locate either "_site"(old) or "CalTTC-Website"(new). Once either of these files is open in VS code, you can open the main file titled "index.html". Right click anywhere on the page and select the option “Open with Live Server”.  This should open a new tab in your browser. With a locally hosted preview of the website. 
5. Make sure it looks something like the actual website: https://calttc.berkeley.edu.  If it does not you may need to refresh your browser tab or save the file in VS Code (if you have made edits).
6. Now you are ready to start messing around with the source code. I have included many notes and links in the actual code itself.  Bootstrap is the system we are using to develop on both mobile and desktop for responsive web design.  I would recommend reading up on this.

Currently, the old website source code from github has a lot of unnecessary baggage.  In order to remove this baggage, I have just created a new website with zero clutter from the start. This being said don't get intimidated by the code. The only code that is actually important is in "_site" for the old website. Since I have written the template for the new website, don't be afraid to message me if you need an explanation of what everything does.

The old website is website is based off of a template called Airspace by Themefisher.  I suggest you download it by going to https://themefisher.com/products/airspace.  To view this theme in VS Code open the folder titled “airspace-premium” after extracting the contents of the “airspace.zip” file. Although we are not using this template anymore because it is too complex, you can just tool around to see the basic structure. 

If you are having trouble getting started with HTML.  I would watch the first few videos from this playlist:
