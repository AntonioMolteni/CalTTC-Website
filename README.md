# CalTTC-Website

Website Directions (MacOS, assumed to almost exactly the same for Windows)

1. Clone website repository from github to your machine: https://github.com/CalTTC/CalTTCwebpage. (I recommend cloning it to a folder on your desktop.)
2. Download Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and get the extensions called “Live Server” and “HTML CSS Support”.  Restart VS Code after.
3. Locate a folder called “_site” in the repository you cloned and open this in VS Code.
4. Inside VS Code, locate the folder called index.html and click on it to view the source html for the home page titled CALTTC.  Right click on the page and select “Open with Live Server”.  This should open a new tab in your browser. With the website. 
5. Make sure it looks something like the actual website: https://calttc.berkeley.edu.  If it does not you may need to refresh your browser tab or Save the file in VS Code.  Saving in VS Code should update the browser tab. 

Currently the website source code from github has a lot of unnecessary baggage that we should get rid of so don’t be intimidated by a lot of the code. The only code that is actually important is in "_site".
The template the website is based off of is called Airspace by Themefisher.  I suggest you download it by going to https://themefisher.com/products/airspace .  To view this theme in VS Code open the folder titled “airspace-premium” after extracting the contents of the “airspace.zip” file. 
As you can see the current website barely resembles the template and has a lot of extra unnecessary information and is also missing features.
If you are having trouble getting started with html.  I would watch the first few videos from this playlist:
